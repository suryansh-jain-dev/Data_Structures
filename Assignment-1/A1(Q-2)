2) Design the logic to remove the duplicate elements from an Array and after the deletion the array should contain the unique elements.
Ans:
Step 1 —> Start
Read the size of the array (n).
Read n elements into the array (arr).

Step 2 —> Remove Duplicates
Loop i from 0 to n - 1:
Loop j from i + 1 to n - 1:
If arr[i] == arr[j]:
Shift all elements from index j+1 to the left by 1 position.
Reduce n by 1.
Decrement j so that the new element at position j is checked again.

Step 3 —> Print the Result
Display the updated array which have only unique elements.

Step 4 —> Stop
